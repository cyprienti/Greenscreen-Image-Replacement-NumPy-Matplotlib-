# Greenscreen-Image-Replacement-NumPy-Matplotlib-
This project implements a simple greenscreen background replacement using only NumPy and Matplotlib. It loads two images — a person in front of a green screen and a forest background — as NumPy arrays, removes the green background, and combines the person with the forest image.
